A few weeks ago I was chatting with Tobias one of the Android engineers
at Nextcloud. He mentioned how he oftened wanted to just share a file
quickly with somebody or just share some text. Basically your own
privately hosted pastebin.

This got me thinking about the amount of files that are stored on my
Nextcloud that are just sitting there because I wanted to quickly share
them with somebody but I forgot to delete them afterwrads. So long story
short I decided to spend some time to write a little Nextcloud app that
allows you to do this.

So I\'m excited to introduce
[DropIt](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/dropit) to the world. It is
available in the app store for Nextcloud 13!

The app ties together a lot of functionality already available in
Nextcloud. There is a simple interface to upload your files or text (any
help on the UI/UX side is appreciated!). And a cron job that deletes
files older than 2 weeks.

So go check it out. And I\'m looking forward to all your pull requests
to the [github repository](https://github.com/rullzer/dropit).
