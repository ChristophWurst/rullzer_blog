Already back in October of 2016
[probonopd](https://github.com/probonopd) made an AppImage for the
Nextcloud Desktop Client. I must admit that back then I did not
immediately try it out since I just run the client from source.

However, this has changed over the last few weeks as we wanted to start
providing binary packages for Linux as well. When I was reading up on
AppImage I got more excited. And since there already was a script to
generate the AppImage I quickly built my very first AppImage.

So I\'m proud to present to you the [Nextcloud Desktop Client
AppImage](https://download.nextcloud.com/desktop/prereleases/Linux/).
This is an AppImage of the latest beta.

Here is a step by step guide on how to run the AppImage:

1.  Download the AppImage
2.  Make the AppImage executable
3.  Run the AppImage

If you made it this far! Congratulations. You are now running the
Nextcloud desktop client from the AppImage!
