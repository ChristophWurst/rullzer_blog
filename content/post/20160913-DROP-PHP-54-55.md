As many of you probably know PHP 7.1 is planned for [release] at the end
of November. As a preparation for this we are already running our test
suite against the PHP 7.1 RC1. And we feel confident that Nextcloud 11
will run smoothly on the PHP 7.1 final for all you bleeding-edge
sysadmins out there! But if you can't wait try out the [daily].

At the same time we are adding PHP 7.1 to our support matrix we are also
saying goodbye to some retired PHP versions. Nextcloud 11 will no longer
support PHP 5.4 and 5.5. As you can see in the [support matrix] both are
no longer supported by upstream PHP.

This change in supported PHP versions allows us to start updating
several third party dependencies. Which bring bugfixes and (security)
improvements. At the same time we could update [PHPUnit] to take
advantage of improvements there.

All in all we feel these changes will allow us to improve our codebase
and move Nextcloud forward. Happy hacking!
